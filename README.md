# hello_graphics
Learning computer graphics from scretch.
I decided to learn this magic (for me) but very interesting area. Since sometimes I play in computer games and think about graphics `how is it possible???`, `how people do that???`, `is it difficult???`.
This repo does not contain any unique resources, only my steps in this wonderfull computer graphics world.

# interactive computer graphics
Wonderful computer graphics course for beginner from [Cem Yuksel](https://www.cemyuksel.com), I highly recommend to visit his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@cem_yuksel) and use [repo](https://github.com/cemyuksel).

Unfortunately not all information is available in youtube lessons but not critical.

# Build
I'm not going to maintain this project for a public usage, mostly as another one short research project, but I tried to exclude most of dependencies (yet).

My environment is **gentoo-x86-64** with **opengl** flag enabled and that's all. I use C code since there are many other resources written in C++, but C is much simple for me at this stage.

Cmake files in this project download required dependencies.
